# E-Commerce Website Design for US Client

This repo contains code files for website design jobs I performed for a US client in Hawaii. I found this client on Upwork.

I built this project on `Weebly` & `eCommerce by Square` website infrastructure.

I built and maintained two websites for the business: [keepitsimplezerowaste.com](https://www.keepitsimplezerowaste.com/) and [keepitsimplewholesale.com](https://www.keepitsimplewholesale.com/).

### Keep It Simple Zerowaste

**Keep It Simple Zerowaste** is a  sustainability company in Hawaii focused on reducing waste proliferation in the beaches and city of Hawaii one refill at a time.
